            Electronic Health Records (EHR) has been the backbone of digital transformation in the last few decades. In comnbination the lab information system (LIMS), they provide and store majority of the health data in the health system. EHR is the main patient information system in the acute hospital setting connected to many sub-systems including LIMS, image databases, administration systems and healthlink (GP reporting system).  Most of the IT budget in a health organisation contributed to the purchasing and maintaining of the EHR and related infractures.  There are large private sector vendors providing systems to the HSE including <a href= "https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/newsfeatures/medlis-the-national-laboratory-information-system/">(MedLIS).</a> program from Cerner used by six major hospitals in Dublin and EHR systems provided by <a href= "https://www.dedalus.com/global/en/">(Dedalus ).</a>

AIX is a proprietary Unix OS developed by IBM.  allowing Concurrent users access.  The apex server is located in a secure off-site centre and managed by ICT staff based in CUH and Dedalus staff remotely from the U.K.  Cluster Aware AIX automation with a repository replacement mechanism facilitates the scaling of usage. Diagram shows a sub-system that could display an alert message to the Accident and Emergency user terminal indicating out-of-range Troponin results for a patient is out of normal range and it is available in the ICM patient system.  Troponin is a very sensitive marker for myocardial infarction (M.I.) which may not be detected very clearly in the ECG diagram.   A timely diagnosis of M.I. is critical.

            A client-server infrastructure is a network architecture where client devices request services or resources from servers. Clients initiate communication, while servers fulfill requests by processing data or serving files. This model enables efficient resource sharing, centralized management, scalability, and security through protocols and techniques like HTTP, load balancing, and encryption.

            Windows Server 2019 is a robust operating system designed for server deployments. Its setup involves installing the OS on a physical or virtual machine, configuring settings such as language, keyboard layout, and licensing, and then customizing roles and features according to the specific needs of the server environment.

            Linux is a versatile and open-source operating system kernel originally developed by Linus Torvalds. It is the foundation for various Linux distributions, which are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Linux distributions are widely used in servers, desktop computers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It supports a vast array of software applications and services, and its open-source nature encourages community-driven development and customization.
