            Digital transformation has been considered the 4th industrial revolution: moving from electronic to digital system with the system as a whole driven by the continuous feedback of data.  Many traditional industries including car manufacturers, retail, and finance transformed within the last decade.   In Ireland, It is a public service provider with its main goal and objective to improve the health of the citizens rather than making a profit.   A good health service is one of the most important factors in the continuous development of a country <a href= "https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-gr15-main-final.pdf">(Deloittle, 2015).</a> Digital transformation could dramatically improve the efficiency of a system.   Becoming data-driven not only increases efficiency more client-orientated by using data feedback.   It is also very important to establish a standard and framework for the utilisation of health data in the organisation <a href= "https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/6b7909-ehealth-strategy-for-ireland/">(eHealth Strategy for Ireland, 2021)</a>.  A good Business intelligence (BI) platform is one of the very important components in the digital transformation process.  Users could use the BI application to analyse and visualise data and use machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to create predictive models to assist users in making decisions based on these models <a href= "https://www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/AR2021.pdf">(ESRI, 2021).</a>

            Interoperability and Data Exchange: There's a growing emphasis on interoperability standards and initiatives to facilitate seamless data exchange among healthcare systems and stakeholders. Efforts to standardize data formats and protocols aim to improve care coordination, support population health management, and enable the use of data for research and analytics.  There are many different information system in different institute in Ireland and the Citrix portal is the meeting places for all these system <a href= "https://www.ehealthireland.ie/ehealth-functions/acute-delivery/maternal-newborn-clinical-management-system-mn-cms-/information-sharing-and-integration/">(eHealth Ireland)</a>.
            AI and Machine Learning: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are transforming healthcare delivery, with applications ranging from diagnostics and predictive analytics to personalized treatment recommendations and population health management. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize patient care by improving accuracy, efficiency, and outcomes.

            Precision Medicine: Health informatics is crucial in advancing precision medicine, which involves tailoring medical treatments and interventions to individual characteristics, such as genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Genomic data and advanced analytics drive insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, leading to more effective treatments.

            Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies, allowing healthcare providers to deliver care remotely while minimising physical contact. These modalities are likely to remain integral components of healthcare delivery, offering convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, particularly for chronic disease management and follow-up care.

            Health Data Privacy and Security: With the increasing digitization of health data, ensuring the privacy and security of patient information is paramount. Regulatory frameworks such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html">(HIPAA).</a> in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation <a href= "https://www.hse.ie/eng/gdpr/">(GDPR).</a> in Europe continue to evolve to address emerging challenges and protect patient confidentiality.

            Healthcare Analytics and Population Health Management: Analytics tools could be for population health management, allowing healthcare organisations to better identify at-risk populations, track health trends, and implement targeted interventions to improve outcomes and reduce costs. Predictive modelling and risk stratification algorithms help identify individuals who may benefit most from proactive interventions.

          Health informatics will continue to play a pivotal role in driving innovation, improving healthcare quality and outcomes, and addressing the evolving needs and challenges of healthcare systems worldwide. Continued collaboration among healthcare providers, technology vendors, policymakers, and researchers will be essential to realizing the full potential of health informatics in the coming years
