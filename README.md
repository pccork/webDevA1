Course: Higher Diploma in Computer Science, Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT

Code source: Modification of codes from  lab created by lecturer John Rellis

Technologies Used: HTML Living Standard and CCS3 

Project title: Beta testing website providing information and resources for Healthcare Digital Transformation

Requirements: Updated Web browsers

Installation Instructions: Opening URL link in a web browser
Usage instruction: The website contains 6 pages including the home page and an index page.  A horizontal navigation bar is used to help users move across these pages.  An additional side menu bar is set to arrange resource links arranged in the relevant grouping. 


Project Objective
The main objective of this web page is to provide users with a summary of information technology employed in the Irish health sector under different sections:
Software Platform, AI/ML, Standards and Regulations and Implementation of digital health project.  This information aims to help users understand the technical aspects, explanation and summary of some of the components in the digital healthcare area.

Visuals
There are two main styles the home page and the rest of the pages.  All pages start with a title on the top page with the main navigation bar underneath it.  The selected page will be highlighted in blue with the main menu bar.  An additional side menu bar is added to each sub-page to allow the linkage of grouped information or resources to relevant areas.   Internal resource links would be the main component planned for the sidebar menu.  A member-restricted area could be included for some of the links in the sidebar menu in the future.  A simplistic style is used for the web page due to the amount of information included in the website.  The main body has been divided into two columns plus primary and secondary boxes horizontally.  The main idea/ information is placed in the main column primary area to allow users to extract the most essential information.  An index page is set to link users to the website.

Project Roadmap
The first stage of information about digital health transformation has been included in the first stage of the website.  The next stage will include setting up a member-only area and providing links to members with in-house applications and templates that could be used in the health digital transformation process.  Interactive educational tools related to different diagnostic models built using Javascript for the public will also be included in the future.

Project Status
The first stage finished.

Acknowledgements
Codes from the lab by lecturer John Rellis have been modified for this website.

Conclusion
This is a beta testing website built for the first web application assignment for the Higher Diploma in Computer Science, Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT.  The multi-page website could be used to act as a focal point for the health digital transformation process in an acute hospital or any small to medium healthcare site.  It not only provides information or relevant links to different digital health areas but it could allow tools and templates linked to the website in an organised manner.
