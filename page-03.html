            What Does FHIR Mean for Healthcare
            The FHIR standard in healthcare can do everything HL7 V2 does and more. It eliminates the limitations of HL7 and has a less steep learning curve. FHIR is not limited to a single encoding syntax, unlike V2. It also has one-to-many data exchange capabilities, offers robust security functions, and cuts implementation time. Simply put, it makes adopting healthcare interoperability simpler. Vendors need less time to connect third-party apps and make them work as a whole. Application to Application Protocol
            The protocol ensures the communication and data exchange between two independent apps, not between client-server type applications. In this case, the message they share is of utmost importance. The role of each app doesn't matter           
          </p>
          <p>
          The implementation of FHIR brought a lot of confusion in the healthcare industry. The companies that used HL7 V2 and other versions started to question what requirements to follow now. Here is a short answer: Even though all these standards implement interoperability, FHIR is considered the most innovative one. Unlike the older standards, it employs open web technologies and RESTful web services that simplify the integration of multiple system components.

            <a href= "https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/clinical-coding-snomed-ct/
            ">SNOMED CT</a> (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive clinical terminology used in healthcare and medical research worldwide. It provides standardized codes and terms for describing healthcare concepts, such as diseases, procedures, medications, and observations. SNOMED CT facilitates interoperability and communication across healthcare systems, enabling better exchange of clinical information between healthcare providers, researchers, and patients. It supports various applications including electronic health records, decision support systems, and clinical research.  Electronic Patient Record implementing SNOMED will allow better data quality in which could lead to more accurated natural language processing models built using these dataset.

            Health Products Regulatory Authority <a href= "https://www.hpra.ie/">(HPRA).</a>Guideline
            The main aspect is to determine if the software or in this case an equation is classified as a medical device.  IT systems that involve the management of data including storage, transfer and presentation of data are not classified as SaMD.   A flow chart is designed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority HPRA regarding the placing of software as a medical device in the market.   Clinical Evaluation and risk assessment will be required by the software vendor to classify the equation.  There are different notification processes required by different classes of SaMD.  In the case of a class 1 device, self-declare conformity by registering manufacturer EAR and device with HPRA will be sufficient.

            Software as a Medical Device  
            The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">(MHRA).</a>
            of the UK has published guidance dedicated to the medical device stand-alone software including applications. The term “Software as a Medical Device” (SaMD) is defined as software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device (IMDF, 2014) and IMDRF/ SaMD WG/N12FINAL: 2014 and the implementation of software/ model in compliance of the EU regulation for in-vitro medical devices <a href= "https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2017/746/contents">(EU) 2017/746 (IVDR).</a>

          A Zero Trust cybersecurity policy is essential in today's digital landscape to mitigate the evolving threats posed by cyberattacks. Traditional perimeter-based security measures are no longer sufficient due to the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the proliferation of remote work and cloud computing. A Zero Trust approach assumes that threats can originate from both inside and outside the network perimeter and requires continuous verification of every user, device, and application attempting to access resources. By implementing principles such as least privilege access, multi-factor authentication, encryption, and continuous monitoring, Zero Trust policies help organizations enhance their security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
